share-dbc
=========

The goal of this site is to share useful learning style based resources within the DBC community. As a team, we believe the best way to learn how to code is to find resources that fit well with an individual's learning style. In order to promote this, we have created Share DBC. On the Share DBC site, users will be able to add resources to specific subjects (i.e. jQuery, CSS, etc.) and learning style categories (i.e. Audio, Visual, etc.).
